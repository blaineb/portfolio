      <h2>Experience designer</h2>
      <p class="callout">I design experiences for software with a focus on delight and motion.  My strengths are in conceptual feature generation and micro-interactions.  For the last three years I have been working on <span class="definition">Inbox, a new approach to email by Gmail.</span></p>

        <h3>Conversation View</h3>
        <p>While email is big in the US and Europe, in emerging markets like Africa, Brazil, and Russia, chat clients are the preferred method of communication.  Along with other awesome features, we knew we needed to make email conversations as easy to consume as chat conversations.  This means expanding the content of the message, getting rid of lots of meta-data, and putting the people first.</p>

      <h3>Out of Box Bundle Settings</h3>
      <p>One of Inbox's core benefits is its ability to move the cruft out of sight so you can focus on what's most important.  Getting long-time Gmail users comfortable with this concept proved difficult.  We tackled this by giving users a very visual, tactile setting screen on their first-time use to empower them to decide just how much cruft they want bundled.</p>

      <h3>Media sharing</h3>
      <p>From calendars to photos on your device to your browsing history, Google houses a lot of your data.  We thought that this put Inbox in a unique place to help you share your photos, files in Google Drive, events details, and recently viewed links more easily than any other communication platform.  This was our design for bringing that content from everywhere right to your fingertips.</p>

        <h3>Smart Reply</h3>
        <p>Typing is still one of the biggest pain points of mobile phone use.  We came up with the idea to mine user response data to bring what you were going to say anyway right to your fingertips.  While the UI for this is simple, we went through training sets of data for countless hours, evaluated what fail cases were unacceptable, and what responses seemed most human and heartfelt.</p>
