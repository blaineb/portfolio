      h2 Fixing search on the world's largest academic network
      //- p Searching the world's largest online database of academic work was an essential part of selling university subscriptions, but you couldn't actually search the paper's contents online!
      p.pd-b-md Search is about more than only the interactions. We interviewed academics to find out what makes a paper relevant to them and how they conduct research online.  I built a browser extension to test variations in the search algorithm, vastly improving relevance.
      p.caption And I designed the interactions, too :)

      p.pd-b-md We implemented a process of defining goals, writing scripts to evaluate concepts with users, and rigorously synthesizing the information afterwards.
      p I worked with Academia to implement a user-centered product approach by testing ideas and talking to users frequently.
